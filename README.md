# Note Taker

## Description

This application allows the user to take notes and store them into a database, where each note consists of a title, a body, and a unique id. This allows the user to refer to their notes at a later time without needing to worry about the data later perishing.

## Functionality

To create a note, simply click in the text fields in the right panel for "Note Title" and "Note Text." Note that each note must have both of these filled out before the note can be saved by clicking on the save icon, which appears on the top right after doing so. You may also either select notes from the left panel to display them in the right panel, or click on their respective delete icons to remove them from the list. If you would like to create a new note while another note is selected, click on the "+" icon in the top left to clear the fields in the right panel to clear the way for a new note.
